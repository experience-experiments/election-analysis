        Nigel and his barmy army did well at the European Elections - ironic we know - but what would happen if that picture was replicated across the country in the general election?
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Effect:</b> Well for one, pub landlords across the country would rejoice. The increase in Kippers photo-ops alone would reinvigorate the pub trade to such an extent Nigel could probably argue it was his long-term economic plan.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Pros:</b> House of Commons debates would be a hell of a lot livelier.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Cons:</b> A bunch of drunk men with access to the nuclear codes? Really?
        </p>

        The nippy sweetie from the North has been swinging punches at the Westminster crowd rather effectively during the campaign and polls suggest Ed’s reds are going to take a beating in Scotland. So what does that look like?
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Effect:</b> The ‘aye’s’ to the left would become ‘och aye’s’ for starters. Could also mean good business for stone masons in the North with the Hadrian’s wall redevelopment project getting the green light.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Pros:</b> Of the ‘smaller’ parties the SNP seem to genuinely know how shake up the status quo.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Cons:</b> The tabloids fish puns quota outstripping our actual fishing quota.

        Ok, so they aren’t ALL nutters but we thought the title was good enough to cover the wide range of other parties in the UK - and we also get to doth our cap to the creators of The Thick of It…
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Effect:</b> If only Screaming Lord Sutch could have lived to see this day we could have rejoiced in watching our PM sit across the table from poe faced Putin with his trademark mega phone and hat. British eccentricity writ large.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Pros:</b> It sure would be different…
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Cons:</b> It sure would be different…

        What do you mean ‘no chance’? If Nick Clegg somehow manages to shake off his 21st Century David Steele Spitting Image caricature and then promises us all we’ll never have to pay any fees, for anything, ever again - and we believe him - it might happen…
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Effect:</b> Yes! We never have to pay any fees for anything, ever again. Shortly followed by a massive collective groan as he gives us a charming wink and performs his George W Bush ‘fool me twice’ impression.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Pros:</b> We never have to pay any fees for anything, ever again.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Cons:</b> We end up paying fees.

        While the words ‘he’s not as bad as I thought he’d be’ are not those which inspire a great deal of confidence in a potential leader, by all accounts Miliband’s popularity is on the rise. If he does manage to shake off his plasticine personality problem what would that look like for the country?
        </p>
        <p>
        Effect: Stephanie Flanders could become the first woman in history to have dated both the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of a sitting government - which would be impressive if it wasn’t the two Ed’s.
        </p>
        <p>
        Pros: More cheese.
        </p>
        <p>
        Cons: Everyone constantly asking ‘do you think his brother would do a better job?’.

        Cameron has been on a bit of a sticky wicket with attacks from both the right and left over his policies - but the former PR man could remain PM if he works can show us all that the difference between those two jobs is more than just a change of letter.
        </p>
        <p>
        Effect: The countdown to him quitting the job will begin… and if you thought austerity was bad, at least Cameron puts his best shiny face on it… Now picture Osborne running the show…
        </p>
        <p>
        Pros: He’s not Osborne…
        </p>
        <p>
        Cons: Having spent three years waiting for Blair to quit do we really need to do it again?
